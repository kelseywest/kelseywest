  <p id="title">HTML & CSS: Exercise 01</p>
  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <p>This page shows an example of very basic HTML with CSS applied to it. For this exercise, you will create:<br>
 <ol>
  <li>New text for your main document</li>
  <li>New p id's (6)</li>
  <li>New CSS for these p id's</li>
   <li>New text in your table</li>
   <li>New CSS for your table</li>
</ol>
The Helpful Tools on Canvas can be of assistance in knowing what the selectors, properties, and values mean. There are also tools for selecting your colors.<p>
  
Once you've completed these steps, you will submit the link to your CodePen and a copy of your complete .html document to Canvas.

<p id="line1">Hello, you're probably wondering why I've called you here today.</p>
  <!—It ain't easy being green. -->
<p id="line2">Well let's talk about it.</p>
<p id="line3and4">There's been an accident. <br>
  A wonderful accident.</p>
<p id="line5">I've turned into a frog.</p>
<p id="line6">The cutest frog you've ever seen.</p>
  <p>
<p id="line7">And now, I must hop!
  </p>
  <h2>Frogs!</h2>
  <!—There are times when you may want to use the div instead of creating a table. Tables are the standard for tabular data, while div is used to define objects on the page and page layout. -->
  <p id="line8">Example 1. Some cool frogs!</p>
  <table id="frogtable">
  <tr>
    <th>Species</th>
    <th>Discovered</th>
    <th>Best Part</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Desert Rain Frog</td>
    <td>1977</td>
    <td>Silly little guys! They look grumpy and have a tiny battle call, but I bet they're full of love!</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Red-eyed Tree Frog</td>
    <td>1862</td>
    <td>Sticky climbing feet! And so brightly colored!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Glass Frog</td>
    <td>1872</td>
    <td>See through! Like glass!!</td>
     </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Me</td>
    <td>2024</td>
    <td>I am a frog now! Best frog ever maybe? </td>
  </tr>
</table>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <!—I could also add notes in the comments. This is pretty common. -->
  Normally, a markup document would appear with the !DOCTYPE at the start of a document, followed by the head, which contains the style, and then the body. CodePen automatically places the HTML first. That means if you want to create a complete .html document from what you've written here, you'll want to copy over the CSS first, followed by the HTML. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ef-LHdB6wwE9RyhcXHVQ251g2xjShC4i5ZRTH8Pv_iY/edit?usp=sharing">Here's what my example pages looks like as an HTML document. </a> (Make sure to open this in a new tab - it's won't load in CodePen.) You can download it and open it in your browser.<p>
  CSS can also exist on its own and you can reference the file. This is called an "external style sheet." If you save a .css file, remove the HTML -- you will only want the CSS to be applied to the pages where you're using it.
  <!—Who's awesome? You're awesome. Look at that beautiful page you made! -->
